                <h2 style="text-align:center"><strong>CAREER</strong></h2>
                <p>In a career that spanned two decades, Kobe Bryant rewrote NBA history while leading the Lakers to the summit of the NBA.</p>
                <p>Drafted by Charlotte when he was only 17 years old, Bryant was quickly traded to the Lakers, who believed in his potential to become a superstar.</p>
                <p>They were rewarded just three years later when Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal led the purple and gold to their first championship together. Kobe shined brightest in Game 4 of the Finals when Shaq fouled out of an overtime meeting with Indiana. Bryant took over, scoring 28 points and providing the game-winning basket in the final second.</p>
                <p>Bryant went on to help the Lakers to two more championships, averaging 24.6 points against Philadelphia in 2001 and 26.8 points in a 2002 sweep over New Jersey. Three years after the three-peat concluded, Bryant began led the league in scoring with 35.4 points per game in 2005-06</p>
                <p>Bryant remained one of the league’s top weapons for the next few seasons, willing the Lakers to a playoff spot in 2012-13. However, that campaign was cut short by the first major injury of the last part of his career, as he tore his Achilles tendon in a late game against Golden State, though he didn’t leave the court until sinking two free throws to ice the victory.</p>
                <p>From there, Bryant found himself constantly dogged by injuries. However, nothing would stop him from a legendary finale on April 13, 2016.</p>
                <p>In the last game of his career, Kobe put on a show that only he could provide, dropping 60 points on the Utah Jazz. As a frenzied Staples Center chanted his name, Bryant caught fire in the final two minutes, scoring 13 straight points to rally the Lakers to victory.</p>
                <p>As the buzzer sounded on that last performance, Bryant ended his career with one of the most impressive resumes in NBA history.</p>
